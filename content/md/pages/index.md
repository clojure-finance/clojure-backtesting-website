Welcome to the Clojure Backtesting Library! This is an open-source library for quantitative finance and trading developed at the HKU Business School. 

## Features

- **Support for large data files**  
  The library has been tested with data up to 30 GB large.

- **All native types**  
  All the datatypes used to store data is native Clojure (or Java) types!  

- **Lazy operations**  
  Some operations will not be executed immediately. Dataframe will intelligently pipeline the operations altogether in computation.  

- **Built-in indicators**  
  Common technial indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Exponential Moving Average (EMA) are integrated within the library.

- **Write your unique trading strategy**  
  Making use of the variety of APIs, you could customise your own strategy and enjoy the advantages of programming in a functional language at the same time.
