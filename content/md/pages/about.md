## Why Clojure

Clojure is a functional programming language that allows developers to work with high-level mathematical abstractions. Its fundamental features of immutability and laziness renders it the ideal candidate tool for financial modeling as well as distributed computation. 

Here are some of the best things about Clojure:

- Clojure is a **JVM-based language**. This means that you're granted full access to Java's myriad of libraries.

- Clojure is designed for **concurrency**. You can save your efforts spent on performance tuning and efficiency, and focus on writing the core functionalities.

- **Lazy data structures** are built-in in Clojure. It enables you to easily load datasets that larger than the memory size of your computer.

According to the recent [Stack Overflow developer survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019), 4 out of 5 of the top paying languages are functional programming languages (Clojure, F#, Scala and Elixir). Functional programming languages have also been gaining popularity in the financial industry, for example Jane Street has been using [OCaml](https://blog.janestreet.com/why-ocaml/) as their primary development language, and many investment banks have made heavy use of Scala.

We believe that there are plenty of underlying potentialities in Clojure. Thus, we would like to make an effort in developing resources for this community. This backtesting library serves to be a resource that assists users to write trading strategies and evaluate the strategy performance.
